# StopWatch in Python
The Stopwatch Game is a simple game that tests the player's reaction time. It is written in Python language and uses the Pygame library for graphics and user input.

When the game starts, a stopwatch is displayed on the screen, counting up from zero. The player's goal is to click a button as quickly as possible when the stopwatch reaches a certain value. The value can be set by the player at the start of the game.

For example, if the player sets the value to 5 seconds, they must click the button as close to exactly 5 seconds as possible. The closer they are to the target time, the higher their score will be.

The game keeps track of the player's best score and displays it on the screen. The player can play as many rounds as they like, trying to beat their best score each time.

The game also has a few additional features to make it more interesting. For example, the stopwatch can change color when it reaches certain milestones (such as every 10 seconds), and the button the player clicks can make a sound or display an animation.

Overall, the Stopwatch Game is a fun and challenging way to test your reaction time and compete with friends.
